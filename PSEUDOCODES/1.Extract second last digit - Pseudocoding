Let's consider any number n, 
	In order to extract the second last digit 
	Let temp = Math.floor(n/10)  the floor value of the number divided by 10
	Let secondLast = temp%10  (the modulo operator will provide the remainder) 
         
 Example - let n = 152 
		Let temp = Math. floor(n/10) = 15
		Let secondLast = temp%10 = 15%10 = 5 
 	Hence the second last number
