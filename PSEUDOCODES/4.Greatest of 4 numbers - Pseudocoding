1.Assign values to four variables: n1, n2, n3, and n4.
2.Set the initial value of a variable called maxNum to n1 (which is 12).
3.Compare maxNum with n2. If n2 is greater than maxNum, update maxNum to n2.
4.Compare maxNum with n3. If n3 is greater than maxNum, update maxNum to n3.
5.Compare maxNum with n4. If n4 is greater than maxNum, update maxNum to n4.
6.Print the value of maxNum, which will be the largest among the four given numbers.
