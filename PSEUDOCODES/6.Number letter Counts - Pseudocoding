1.Create an object with the keys as numbers ranging from 0 to 9 and the value as their word representation.

    let obj={
            0:"zero",
            1:"one",
            2:"two",
            3:"three",
            4:"four",
            5:"five",
            6:"six",
            7:"seven",
            8:"eight",
            9:"nine"
        }

2.Convert the input Number into an array.
3.Iterate through the array and if the particular element is present in the object, then count the length of its word representation. 
4.Return the sum of the length of the element's word representation.
